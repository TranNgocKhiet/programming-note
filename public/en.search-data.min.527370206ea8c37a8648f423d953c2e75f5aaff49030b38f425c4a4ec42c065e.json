However, Python does consider the integer 42 to be the same as the float 42.0.\u0026quot;\n- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Swigart, Chapter 2 - bool() funtion#\rWhen used in conditions, 0, 0.0, and \u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; (the empty string) are considered False, while all other values are considered True.\n- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Swigart, Chapter 3 - None value#\rIn Python, a value called None represents the absence of a value. The None value is the only value of the NoneType data type. (Other programming languages might call this value null, nil, or undefined). Just like the Boolean True and False values, you must always write None with a capital N.\nThis value-without-a-value can be helpful when you need to store something that shouldn’t be confused for a real value in a variable. One place where None is used is as the return value of print(). The print() function displays text on the screen, and doesn’t need to return anything in the same way len() or input() does. But since all function calls need to evaluate to a return value, print() returns None. To see this in action, enter the following into the interactive shell:\nspam = print(\u0026#39;Hello!\u0026#39;)Result: Hello!\nNone == spamResult: True\nBehind the scenes, Python adds return None to the end of any function definition with no return statement. This behavior resembles the way in which a while or for loop implicitly ends with a continue statement. Functions also return None if you use a return statement without a value (that is, just the return keyword by itself).\n- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Swigart, Chapter 4 - Named Parameters#\rOn the other hand, Python identifies named parameters by the name placed before them in the function call. You’ll also hear named parameters called keyword parameters or keyword arguments, though they have nothing to do with Python keywords. Programmers often use named parameters to provide optional arguments. For example, the print() function uses the optional parameters end and sep to specify separator characters to print at the end of its arguments and between its arguments, respectively.\nprint(\u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#39;World\u0026#39;)Result:\nHello\rWorldprint(\u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;, end=\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#39;World\u0026#39;)Result: HelloWorld\nprint(\u0026#39;cats\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;dogs\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mice\u0026#39;)Result: cats dogs mice\nprint(\u0026#39;cats\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;dogs\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mice\u0026#39;, sep=\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;)Result: cats,dogs,mice\n"}]
